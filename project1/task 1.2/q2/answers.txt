I believe the delay will be around 160ms.
The throughput will be: 20mbit/s because that is the bottle neck in the path to h4.

This is because when you open the proj1_topo.py, you can get information on all the switches and links in regards to their back and forth delay and corresponding mbit speed for that connection.

To measure the latency, you find the sum of latencies from all the switches leading from h1 to h4, and then the sum in reverse. From h1-h4 the sum is 80, so on the way back it should be another 80, leading to a total RTT of 160.

The measured RTT avg was 164, which although isn't exactly my prediction, is very close. This variation could be due to timing differences between the server/client and very small errors. I would like to think my prediciton was still pretty accurate.

The measured throughput was 17.5mbit/s at h1 and 24.0mbit/s at h4 which was expected considering the first switch out of h1 has a link speed of 20mbit and the first switch out of h4 has a link speed of 30mbit.
This averages out to 20.4 which is close to 20mbit/s which was my prediction. The throughput will always be limited by the slowest node.
